# Short Video Platform ‚Äì Final Delivery

##  Project Overview

This project implements a **scalable, low-latency backend for a short-form video platform** using a **hybrid architecture with PostgreSQL and Firebase Realtime Database**.

It is designed to handle **real-time user interactions under viral load conditions** while ensuring **transactional consistency, scalability, and low latency**. The platform currently supports:

- User registration and session management.
- Video uploads and user interactions (views, likes, comments).
- Creator subscriptions, virtual gifts, and ad campaign tracking.
- Real-time ingestion and retrieval of user interaction data using Firebase.
- Transactional data management with PostgreSQL.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL**: ACID-compliant, advanced queries for transactional data.
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: Real-time ingestion and synchronization of user interactions.
- **Node.js**: Backend scripts for data ingestion, retrieval, and testing.
- **Python (Matplotlib)**: Data visualization for performance analysis.
- **Firebase Admin SDK + pg library**: Database interfacing.
